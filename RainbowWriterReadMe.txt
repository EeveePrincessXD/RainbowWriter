Rainbow Writer is a dynamic drawing tool that lets you adjust how you draw by using the 
keyboard while drawing. A series of simple keyboard commands, you can adjust the color, 
transparency, and thickness of the line you use. The controls are as follows:

Colors (work on an RGB system, all components start at 0):
Red: R to increase, E to decrease
Green: G to increase, F to decrease
Blue: B to increase, V to decrease

Alpha levels (lower levels add transparency, set at full opacity to start):
A to increase
D to decrease

Line Thickness (initially set at a minimum of 2):

W to increase
S to decrease

You can also save an image of your drawing by clicking the Save button, and reset the 
program to its initial state by clicking the Clear button.
